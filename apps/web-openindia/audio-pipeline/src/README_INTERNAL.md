Internal notes

- Keep `synthesizeSpeech` pure (no side-effects) so it is unit-testable.
- Upload path should be configurable. Filenames are sanitized by `sanitizeFilename` before uploading.
- Signed URLs are generated by default as convenience for clients; set `generateSignedUrlForSeconds` to 0 to skip.
